summary,system,event,Splunk,"Default Indexes",30,"In Splunk, summary indexing is an alert option for scheduled saved searches. When you run a saved search with summary indexing turned on, its search results are temporarily stored in a file ($SPLUNK_HOME/var/spool/splunk/<savedsearch_name>_<random-number>.stash). From the file, Splunk uses the addinfo command to add general information about the current search and the fields you specify during configuration to each result. Splunk then indexes the resulting event data in the summary index that you've designated for it (index=summary by default).  Note: Use the addinfo command to add fields containing general information about the current search to the search results going into a summary index. General information added about the search helps you run reports on results you place in a summary index."
